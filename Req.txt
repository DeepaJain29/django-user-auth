Project Overview
The goal is to build a secure and efficient registration and login system using Django. This system will enable users to create accounts, log in, and manage their sessions. We will also include functionality for password reset, user profile management, and email verification. The application should have a user-friendly interface and a secure backend for handling authentication.

Features and Requirements
1. User Registration
Registration Form: Create a registration form where users can input their details, including:

Full Name
Email Address (unique)
Password (with validation)
Confirm Password (to ensure consistency)
Password Validation: Ensure the password meets security requirements (e.g., minimum length, mix of characters, etc.)

Email Validation: Check that the provided email is valid and not already registered.

Account Creation: On successful registration, a user record should be created in the database, and a welcome email with an account activation link should be sent.

User Activation via Email: Send a confirmation email with a unique activation link (token) that the user needs to click to activate their account.

2. User Login
Login Form: Create a login form with fields for:

Email Address
Password
Authentication: Authenticate users by checking their credentials (email and password) against the database.

Session Management: On successful login, create a user session to keep the user logged in across pages.

Error Handling: Display clear error messages for incorrect credentials (email or password), inactive accounts, and account lockout if too many failed login attempts are detected.

3. Password Reset
Forgot Password Form: Allow users to reset their password if they forget it.

Email to Reset Password: When a user requests a password reset, send an email with a password reset link (with a token).

Reset Password Form: The link should lead to a form where users can input a new password and confirm it.

Password Reset Confirmation: Once the password is successfully reset, notify the user via email and update the password in the database.

4. User Profile Management
View Profile: Users should be able to view their profile information, such as name and email address.

Edit Profile: Users should be able to edit their profile information (excluding email and password).

Change Password: Allow users to change their password from their profile page after verifying the current password.

5. Security Features
Password Hashing: Use Django’s built-in password hashing system to securely store user passwords.

Session Timeout: Implement session timeout after a certain period of inactivity to enhance security.

Rate Limiting: Implement rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks on login and password reset endpoints.

Two-Factor Authentication (Optional): Allow users to enable two-factor authentication for added security.

6. User Authorization
User Roles: Implement different user roles (e.g., Admin, Regular User) and permissions to control access to different parts of the application.

Admin Panel: Implement Django’s admin panel to manage user accounts, including activating/deactivating accounts, viewing user data, and resetting passwords.

7. Frontend/UI
Responsive Design: The registration and login pages should be mobile-responsive, providing a smooth user experience on all screen sizes.

Error Feedback: Provide clear and user-friendly error messages for common registration/login issues (e.g., invalid email format, weak password, incorrect credentials).

Success Feedback: Display confirmation messages when the user successfully registers, logs in, or resets their password.

8. Backend & Database
Database Models: Create Django models for the following:

User (extend Django's built-in User model if needed)
ActivationToken (to store email verification tokens)
PasswordResetToken (for managing password reset links)
Database Structure:

User: fields like id, name, email, password_hash, is_active, role
ActivationToken: fields like user, token, expiration_date
PasswordResetToken: fields like user, token, expiration_date
9. Testing & Validation
Unit Tests: Write unit tests for:
Registration and login functionality
Email verification and password reset process
Profile management and password change
Integration Tests: Perform integration testing to ensure the system works end-to-end (e.g., registering, verifying email, logging in, and password reset).
10. Deployment and Monitoring
Deployment: Deploy the system to a production server (e.g., using Heroku, AWS, or DigitalOcean) and configure for optimal performance.

Monitoring: Set up monitoring to track failed login attempts, account activations, and other critical user events.

11. Documentation
Code Documentation: Ensure the codebase is well-documented with clear explanations of key components, especially in the authentication flow.

User Documentation: Create user-facing documentation explaining how to register, log in, reset passwords, and update their profiles.

Tech Stack
Backend: Django (with Django Rest Framework if APIs are needed)
Frontend: HTML, CSS (Bootstrap for responsive design)
Database: PostgreSQL (or MySQL, SQLite for development)
Authentication: Django’s built-in authentication system (with optional third-party libraries for features like two-factor authentication)
Email Backend: SMTP (configured for development and production environments)
